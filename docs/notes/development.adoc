== Questions

* RServe:
** Data service has an RServe client wrapping RServe functionality, should this
   type be moved to common or something similar constructed for eda-compute?
** Where does RServe live?
*** *_Answer_*: RServe lives in a separate container which is available through
    the docker compose stack.

* What are some simple example specs that I can use for testing?

* What does a request payload look like? +
  Do I have any control over this, or is this something that will be handled by
  others?
** *_Answer_*: It appears that I have some say over the payload.  The outer
  envelope type is defined by me, but contains a "config" property that is
  defined by the plugin developers.

* Can a RAML DataType's parent's "facets" be used to enforce implementing
  generic properties? +
  For example, could I have a `BaseRequest` type that defines a "config" facet,
  and have child types required to use that facet?
** *_Answer_*: No, but you can override facets with subtypes.

.Example
[source, yaml]
----
types:
  Foo:
    type: object
    properties:
      fizz: any
  Bar:
    type: Foo
    properties:
      fizz: Buzz

* How do we get the metadata from the EDA Subsetting Service?
** *_Answer_*: Using the study ID which will be a field on the job request
   envelope type.

* How do we get the merge data from the EDA Merge Service?
** *_Answer_*: Using the study ID and API filters that are fields on the job
   request envelope type.

* How do we hold onto the job request envelope data (study ID, derived
  Variables, etc.) to use when running the job?
** Do we pass the whole request through the queue and pop out the parts we need
   when it's time to run the job?
** *_Answer_*: Yes, the full request payload will need to be passed down the
   line.  It includes several fields that are needed to make requests to the
   other EDA services.

* Looking at the EDA Data Service's docker-compose file, it looks like it spins
  up its own, owned instances of EDA Subsetting, EDA Merging, RServe, EDA User,
  Dataset Access, and Dataset Download. +
  *_Question_*: Is this the structure in production or is this just the local
  stack definition?


== Request workflow

. Request comes in
. Get hold of a plugin instance to validate the input. +
*_Question_*: Does this need to be a full plugin instance or can it be something
like a "PluginConfigValidator"?
. Validate the input
. Submit job to the queue


== Executor Workflow

. Get hold of a plugin instance
. Using plugin, parse raw json config coming from job queue back into plugin
  config
. Using the parsed config:
.. Fetch the metadata from the eda-subsetting service. +
... Write the metadata out to file in the plugin workspace
... Create a ReferenceMetadata instance? +
    (To do this, we will need a handle on the derived variables which are part
    of the request envelope.  This means the envelope data will need to be held
    onto in some way)
.. Fetch the tabular data from the eda-merge service. +
*_Question_*: How does this even work?

== TODO

. Create a dummy plugin that does simple things just to aid development
